 * better handling when a file have no tags -> we must then switch to another filename creation method
 * file overwrite is done only one time when  adding to ConverterQueue, this is really bad when we don't have tags!
   maybe just don't name with tags when there are no tags ? :)
 * encoders as plugins 
 * optional "advanced" encoder settings
 * give time estimates for progress bar
 * HIG compliant interface
 * progress dialog ?
 * autotools, l12n
 * handle exceptions even when they happen in callbacks
 * add support for GNOME encoding profiles ?

 * bug: the program's options aren't printed with --help
 * bug: "use same folder" donesn't work right.

 -ok- dropping a list a folder does not work as expected
 -ok- handle error when overwriting a file
 -ok- bug: the dialog can only be showed once
 -ok- use a raw quality setting
